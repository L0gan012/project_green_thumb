This project was created to help Logan not kill his plants.

It will store moisture and temperature data for all the plants in his apartment.
Adafruit sensors will be used to collect watering data.

When moisture levels reach a certian, predetermined, threshold Logan will be alerted to water his plants.
Data can be viewed in several graphical formats.
